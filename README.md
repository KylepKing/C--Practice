C++ Practice Repository:

Welcome to my C++ Practice Repository. This project contains a personal collection of around 60 C++ practice problems, ranging from beginner to intermediate level.


Purpose:

The goal of this repository was to learn and understand the syntax of C++ by solving practical exercises. Through this process, I aimed to become comfortable with the core features of the language and improve my problem-solving skills using C++.


This repository covers a variety of important and relevant topics in C++, including:

-Variables and Data Types

-Conditionals and Loops

-Functions and Recursion

-Arrays and Strings

-Pointers and References

-Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, etc.)

-File Input and Output

-Basics of the Standard Template Library (STL)

-Dynamic Memory Management

-Simple Projects and Algorithms

Each file focuses on a specific concept or exercise to help reinforce understanding of both syntax and logic.




How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KylepKing/CPP-Practice.git

Navigate to the folder and compile any file:

g++ filename.cpp -o output

./output


Learning Outcome:

By completing these exercises, I achieved:

-A solid understanding of C++ syntax

-Familiarity with how C++ handles memory, objects, and the standard library

-Confidence to begin working on more advanced topics and projects in C++



Future Plans:

This repository served as a foundation for learning the C++ language. My next goal is to apply this knowledge in game development using Unreal Engine 5, which relies heavily on C++. Having built a strong grasp of the languageâ€™s fundamentals, I feel prepared to begin exploring Unreal's development environment, create gameplay mechanics, and eventually build full-featured projects within the engine.
